          <p>
            We approach every aspect of our business with sustainability in
            mind. That's why we believe it's always worth trying to fix a system
            before outright replacing it, wherever possible – it requires fewer
            materials and is easier on the planet, as well as your wallet! If
            another company tells you that your system needs to be replaced,
            just give us a call and we'll see if we can repair it first.

                and Cornwall. If we were to sum ourselves up in a few words,
                those would be "reliable, honest and friendly." We find our

                As I'm sure you'll have seen, solar systems don't tend to come

                we price ourselves in a way that makes solar energy more
                affordable. We're focused on helping you and on helping the
                environment, rather than on turning a profit.
